    "insight": "When new entity types are added as valid Boss types in `getValidEntities()` (like MANNEQUIN), also check `canHaveEquipment()` in Boss.java \u2014 it only allows Monster subclasses, PLAYER, HORSE, and ARMOR_STAND. Non-Monster LivingEntity types (e.g., MANNEQUIN) must be explicitly added or the equipment GUI shows \"This Boss type does not support equipment.\" The underlying spawn-time equipment application works for any LivingEntity regardless, so manual YAML edits would work even without the GUI fix.",
