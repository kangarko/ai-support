    "insight": "Boss health bar shows 0 while boss is still alive when using high armor/Protection enchantments: caused by double-subtraction in `HealthBarUtil.display()` which runs 5 ticks after the damage event (health already reduced) but subtracts `damage` again. Fix: pass `0` as damage to `HealthBarUtil.display()` and use `Remain.getFinalDamage(event)` instead of `event.getDamage()`.",
