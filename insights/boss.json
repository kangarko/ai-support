    "insight": "The ReinforcementsMenu (DeathMenu inner class) has a `canEditItem` method that validates placed items. When fixing or extending item validation in menu containers that accept multiple item types (e.g., both Boss eggs and vanilla monster eggs), always null-check the resolved item since both `clicked` and `cursor` parameters can be null simultaneously in Bukkit inventory click events.",
