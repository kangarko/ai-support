Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

    "insight": "When using Image_Head (or Image_File/Image_Url) in a format part, the number of `Message` lines should ideally match the `Image_Height` (default 8). Lines beyond the image height appear below the image without the pixel-art prefix. Users must also set `Performance.Async_Motd: true` in settings.yml when using Image_Head in the MOTD format, since `drawFromHead` makes a blocking HTTP call to the Avatar API (minotar.net).",
