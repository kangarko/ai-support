Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

Without it, books are never saved to the database, so clicking the spy link fails with \"book not found.\" This is the most common cause of book spy not working \u2014 users enable `Spy.Apply_On: [book]` but forget the separate `Log.Apply_On` setting.",
