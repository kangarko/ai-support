Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

Proxy command rules require the proxy module's own `rules/command.rs` file, which uses the same `match` regex syntax and inherits all `ProxyOperator` actions (`then deny`, `then warn`, `then proxy`, etc.).",
