Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

A fix was proposed in PR #3462 to add a fallback that executes sender-only operators (discord, console, log, notify, write) when no receivers were processed.",
