Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

    "insight": "Large rule files with many individual `match` directives cause lag because each rule is evaluated sequentially. The key optimization is consolidating words into alternation patterns (`match \\b(word1|word2|word3)\\b`) and using `then abort` on deny rules to stop further evaluation. Books are especially affected since every page is checked independently.",
