Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

    "insight": "The `/forward` command between backend servers (e.g., auth\u2192survival) silently fails when the target server has no online players, because the proxy relay skips empty servers (`isEmpty()` check). Unlike mute sync which queues for later delivery, FORWARD_COMMAND messages are dropped with no error feedback. Additionally, `Enable_Forward_Command` in VelocityControl/BungeeControl defaults to `false` and must be explicitly enabled.",
