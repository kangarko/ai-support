Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

    "insight": "When users report \"bypass caps not working\", the caps correction may be coming from another plugin rather than ChatControl. ChatControl's default anti-caps message is \"Please avoid excessive capitalization in your {type}.\" (locale key `checker-caps` in `en_US.json`) and is sent as a chat message, not a title. If the user sees a different message (e.g., \"Too many caps\" as a title), another plugin is responsible. Ask users to confirm the exact message text and format to rule this out early.",
