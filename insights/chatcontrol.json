When both servers have ChatControl, cross-server chat works via the channel system (`Proxy: true` on the channel + `proxy.yml` Enabled on each backend) \u2014 Chat_Forwarding should be `false` in that case. Users frequently confuse these two mechanisms and toggle Chat_Forwarding thinking it's needed for normal cross-server channels.",
