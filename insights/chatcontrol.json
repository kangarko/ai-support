Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

    "insight": "When `Backward_Compatible: true` (default) under `Tag:` in settings.yml, ChatControl pulls nicknames from EssentialsX/CMI. If EssentialsX allows `&k` (obfuscated) or `&l` (bold) in nicks via `essentials.nick.magic`/`essentials.nick.format` permissions, those formatting codes leak into all subsequent text in chat formats (/helpop, /ac, channels). Fix: remove those EssentialsX permissions, or switch to ChatControl's own nick system by setting `Backward_Compatible: false` and `Apply_On: [nick]`.",
