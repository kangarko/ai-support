Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

A key diagnostic pattern: if messages work FROM the hybrid server TO Paper but NOT the reverse, the hybrid server's inbound PluginMessageListener delivery is broken. This is a platform limitation, not a ChatControl bug. Direct users to report to their hybrid server's issue tracker.",
