Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

Without the reset, only the first matching group's operators execute \u2014 messages still display for all groups but their side-effect operators are silently skipped.",
