Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

    "insight": "The `@prolong` annotation in rule replacements treats the **last character** of the text after `@prolong[:N] ` as the character to repeat; everything before it is a one-time prefix. This allows combining MiniMessage formatting with prolong, e.g. `then replace @prolong:1 <hover:show_text:'$1'><!shadow>\u23f9` will wrap the repeated \u23f9 characters in a hover tag. The prolong character must always be the final character in the replacement string.",
