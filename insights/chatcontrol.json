Users must disable DiscordSRV's built-in chat relay by setting `DiscordChatChannelMinecraftToDiscord: false` in DiscordSRV's `config.yml`, otherwise messages get duplicated. ChatControl checks this on startup and logs a warning if it's still enabled (see ChatControl.java line ~247).",

To play a sound to all online players with a permission, use `then sound for <permission> <sound> [volume] [pitch]` (added in response to #3423). This mirrors the `then notify <permission> <message>` pattern. The broadcast is guarded by `firstTimeRun` and excludes the sender (who already receives it via `then sound`).",
